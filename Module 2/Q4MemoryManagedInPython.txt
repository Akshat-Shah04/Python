Q4) How is Memory Managed in Python?
Ans) Memory  is managed in python through various components working together to handle, memory allocation, deallocation and garbage collection.
	
	1. Python uses a private heap space to manage memory for its objects and data structures.
	2. When a object is created in python it is allocated to the private heap space.
	3. To better manage the memory in python, each object is given a reference count which tracks the number of reference to the object.
	4. Python has a garbage collector which is responsible for collecting and clearing the objects that are no longer usable.
