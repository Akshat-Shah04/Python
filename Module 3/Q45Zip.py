Q) Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
=>    The zip() function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (like lists, tuples, or strings) into a single iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the iterables. This is particularly useful when you need to pair corresponding elements from two or more iterables.
