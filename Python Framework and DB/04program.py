Ques : What is Django URLs?make program to create django urls
Ans : 
-> Django URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are used to map specific web requests to views in your application. 
-> They define the routes or endpoints that users can access. 
-> When a request comes to the server, Django checks the URL patterns defined in the urls.py file to determine which view should handle the request.

Basic Structure of Django URLs
-> urls.py in Project Directory: Main URL configurations that include the app-level URLs.
-> urls.py in Application Directory: URL configurations specific to an app within the project.
